# Code Guidelines

## 1. Think Before Coding

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
